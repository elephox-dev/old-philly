# Project Overview

The idea behind the project structure is to have the code for your application separate from the framework code.
To achieve this, Philly is just a dependency for your application.
Dependencies get managed via [composer](https://composer.org), so Philly is a composer dependency
([see here on packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/ricardoboss/Philly)).

[`ricardoboss/Philly`](https://github.com/ricardoboss/Philly) is the PHP framework which contains the building blocks
for your application.

[`ricardoboss/PhillyFramework`](https://github.com/ricardoboss/PhillyFramework) is a template for applications, which
use the Philly framework.

To create an application using Philly, please continue with the [Installation](/getting-started/installation).
